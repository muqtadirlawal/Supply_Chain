## Business Problem
SmartHome Solutions Inc. faces a significant challenge in optimizing its supply chain and production planning. The traditional approach to production planning, based primarily on historical data and market forecasts, poses various obstacles:

 - Customer Disconnection: The company lacks a deep understanding of its diverse customer base, making it challenging to align production with specific customer demands. 
 - Inventory Management: Inefficient production planning has led to excess inventory, tying up valuable resources and impacting the company's profitability. 

## Rationale for the Project
The logistics and supply chain industry is undergoing a significant transformation, necessitating a data-driven approach. Here are the top five reasons highlighting the significance of this project:
 - Operational Efficiency: By leveraging customer data, SmartHome Solutions Inc. can streamline production processes, reduce operational costs, and optimize resource allocation, leading to a more efficient supply chain.

### Overview
![](Overview.png)

This page focuses on the key factors driving attrition and highlights the main retention risks to management.
- We see that the Company has a total of 2,940 employees, 474 of those left the company during the period in consideration. This gives an Attrition rate of 16%.
- We see that tenure is a significant factor, with 364 employees out of 474 (~77%) leaving within the first 10 years.
- Attrition is concentrated in Research & Development, particularly in roles such as Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and research Scientists, which are essential to the company's operations.
- Job satisfaction and Commuting distance also contribute to turnover, with 132 (40%) employees that left having long commutes to work.
- Alarmingly, McCurr is losing it's top performers (84%), with some of them working overtime, suggesting possible burn out.

These are the key areas where targeted interventions can help retain the company's best talents and reduce attrition.

### Demographics & Job Roles
![](Demography.png)

Here, we'll have a closer look into who- which employee demographics and job roles are most impacted by attrition.
- We see that Attrition is higher among male employees (63%) and single employees (50%), especially among the 26-35 age group, who may be seeking better oppportunities.
- Also, attrition is predominant in junior/entry-level roles (Job Role 1) at 60%, indicating thet junior staff may lack engagement or growth paths.

Retention strategies focusing on career development and engagement for these groups can reduce turnover.

### Satisfaction and Work-Life Balance
![](Satisfaction.png)

This page explores how job satisfaction, work-life balance, and the work-environment affect attrition.
- Job satisfaction is a key factor, with 28% (132) of employees that left expressing dissatisfaction with their jobs.
- Interestingly, 254 of the 474 employees that left had an excellent work-life balance, meaning other factors like job satisfaction and overtime (worked by 53.5% of leavers) may be driving attrition.
- The work environment also played a role, with 144 employees who left expressing dissatisfaction with it.

### Performance and Compensation
![](Performance.png)

- The majority of employees who left earned between 1k-5k per month, indicating that compensation could be a factor.
- 84% of those who left are excellent performers, meaning the Company is losing it's top talents.
- Employees who received the lowest salary hikes were more likely to leave, suggesting that financial recognition may be inadequate.

## Recommendations

Focus Retention Efforts on Employees with 1-10 Years of Tenure:

- 77% of attrition comes from employees who have been with the company for not more than 10 years. To retain talent, management should enhance career development, offer growth opportunities, and focus on engaging employees in their early years at the company.

Improve Job Satisfaction, especially in Critical Roles:

- 28% of employees who left were dissatisfied with their jobs, and the company is losing top performers (84%), particularly in Research & Development and key job roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives. Management should address job satisfaction through role-specific interventions, such as career growth, recognition, and feedback.


Address the Impact of Overtime and Distance from Work:

- 53% of employees who left worked overtime, and 40% lived far from work, indicating possible burnout and commuting issues. Offering flexible working options and reducing excessive overtime could improve retention and work-life balance, particularly for those affected by long commutes.
